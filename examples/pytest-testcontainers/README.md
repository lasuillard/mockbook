# Example pytest using Testcontainers

A simple example of using pytest with Testcontainers.

To run tests, run the following commands:

```bash
$ uv run pytest .
```

It takes a while to run the first time, as it needs to download the image from remote. Subsequent runs will be faster, as the image is stored locally.
